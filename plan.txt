[ ] Implement HTTP header parser (std::string, boost::regex, w/o optimization)
    [ ] Request line
    [ ] Headers
    [ ] Query string
    [ ] Connection (keep-alive, close)
    [ ] Cookies (?)
[ ] Write test for all kinds of HTTP requests (methods, header combinations) ensure that parser is working
    [ ] OPTIONS
    [ ] GET
    [ ] HEAD
    [ ] POST
    [ ] PUT
    [ ] PATCH
    [ ] DELETE
    [ ] TRACE
    [ ] CONNECT
[ ] Think about the way how to pass request body to middleware (streams?)
